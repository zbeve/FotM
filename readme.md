# Spotify Favourites

This is a small web app that I built in attempt to get a better grasp of the OAuth2.0 process, to play around with the Spotify API, and to implement TailwindCSS.

The app has a simple landing page that will prompt you to login with your Spotify account. After doing so, it will proceed to show you your top tracks and artists.

It will also show you a profile of the song if you choose top tracks.

## Installation

<ol>
	<li>Clone this to your local machine</li>
	<li>Run `composer install` and setup your `.env` file (ensure you Spotify redirect URI matches that in your routes file)</li>
	<li>That's it, you're good to go!</li>
</ol>
