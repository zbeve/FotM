# Spotify Favourites

This is a small web app I am building in attempt to understand the OAuth2.0 process, use the Spotify API, and to better grasp the MVC framework of Laravel.

The landing page will prompt the user to login with their Spotify account. After, it will display the Favorites of the Month playlist that is curated by me and my friends.

The web-app will allow users to vote on tracks and leave comments, while sending push notifications when the playlist is updated and user feedback is left.

This is meant to extend and enrich the Spotify experience.

<!-- ## Installation

	<li>Clone this to your local machine</li>
	<li>Run `composer install` and setup your `.env` file (ensure you Spotify redirect URI matches that in your routes file)</li>
	<li>That's it, you're good to go!</li>
</ol> -->
