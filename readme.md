# Spotify - Favorites of the Month

This is a small web app I am developing to better my understanding as Laravel as a framework and work with dependencies that are unfamiliar to me.

Everything is being developed in attempt to follow best practices for PHP development and overall Laravel structure.

This web app is meant to extend and enrich the stock Spotify experience for the users of the FotM playlist.

## The app includes the following dependencies:

<ol>
	<li>OAuth2</li>
	<li>Spotify API</li>
	<li>Google Firebase GCM Protocol</li>
  <li>Scheduled Cron commands</li>
</ol>
